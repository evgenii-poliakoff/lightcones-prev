    "The quantum mechanics has the time-reversal symmetry. Namely, consider some interval $\\left[0,T\\right]$. Suppose at $t=0$\n",
    "we are given initial wavefunction $\\Psi\\left(0\\right)$.\n",

    "## Implications for the Lieb-Robinson lightcone\n",
    "\n",
    "The time reversal symmetry has deep implications for the Lieb-Robinson lightcone. Suppose we are interested only in the reduced state of the local observable. In terms of our illustrative example {eq}`quench_hamiltonian`, this is the state of atom connected to site 0 of the chain. Consider the final joint wavefunction of the atom and the chain $\\left|\\Psi\\left(T\\right). It is some correlated many-body state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us evolve it backwards in time. We apply the time-reversal {eq}`backward_wavefunction` and perform the forward evolution using the lightcone-restricted Hamiltonian of section {ref}`inside_lightcone`. The lightcone is estimated as described in section {ref}`lr_metric`. \n",
    "As we have discussed in {ref}`lc_deriv_through_intensity`, the lightcone works even if the initial state of the environment is highly correlated, \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we have the initial condition\n",
